							<h2>Past</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Education</h3>
							<p>I have been to North Huddersfield Trust School and during my time there I took part in a key role of house captin, My time at this role built my presentaion skills and communication in groups</p> 
							<h3>Activites</h3>
							<p>In the past I have done a few sporty activtys such as parkour and rock climbing.Doing these things really emphised the importantance of not giving up as you will eventualy get it right,for example I was trying to learn a vault and I couldn't do it at all on the 1st day but after a few hours of trying I was getting more consistent at it. </p>

							<h2>Future</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Plan/Goal</h3>
							<p>In the future I aspire to be a software programmer or Game programmer, Coding really intrests me and at the moment seems easy to me once I understand the language.We are currently having meetings with employers and asking about thier path and what they look for when employing.It seems like work related experiance is even more important than a degree so I may consider going into employment straight away. ethier way im going to keep my options open and apply to university as both are a good option.</p>

							<h2>Present</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Education</h3>
							<p>at the moment I am studying At Shipley collage Doing the Digital T-level course. On the course we are covering many areas from business to coding to work skills. So far we have coded in Python,HTMl and CSS.We have also covered business espects such as gantt charts ,ethicality,big data,Diffrent types of data and so much more.The course is equlivent to 3 A-levels and requires Industrial placement.I personally think the course is great as it gives empolyabilty after and knowledge to progress to a job or university.I am currently the class rep along with another student </p>
							<h3>Activites</h3>
							<p>In my spare time between studing I code various programs and go out quad biking with my family and rest of time im rather talking to friends or playing games. playing games has defintely improved my teamwork skills as It has got me used to communicating both fast and efficiently.its also has helped honed my reaction time and muscle memory.While games are primarily used for enterainment I believe they also teach things you can't learn from book, for example most games have a online option and that alone can improve social skills and teamworking and even non verbal communication.I have coded a few programs but unfortnutly with sudden lockdown in March 2020 i lost all access to my file area but i can explain the basic princple of a few, one of them as a battle system of sort that allowed the user to select a difficulty and face 3 monsters of that difficulty, getting tougher each time, depending on diffulcty the enemies health and damage would be adjusted.the program was my largest project I did before Quarintine and it used varoius imports to make it more fun and intresting.Another program I started to mess around with was a drawing based python libary that would randomly genrate a number then depending on number move up,down,left ,right, turn etc and it made some really nice looking patterns.</p>
